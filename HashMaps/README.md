This is a Storage Manager program which uses hashmaps to quickly and effectively store and retrieve Storage objects in a hash table, emulating a storage locker facility. The classes are also serializable so that the previous state of the storage locker can be saved and restored, which is stored as storage.obj. A sample storage object is provided.
