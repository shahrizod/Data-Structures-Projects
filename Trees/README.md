This program utilizes trees, in this case a ternary tree structure, in order to play the game of Zork, where you get to make decisions affecting the outcome of a story. This program also can read and write to .txt files in order to allow importing of stories and populating them into trees accordingly if the .txt follows a certain format. A sample text file is provided for the user to be able to quickly load in a story and play the game as well as show the format the story is stored with.
